Welcome to NI-HPC Documentation!
===================================

The NI-HPC Centre is a UK Tier-2 National High Performance Computing (HPC) facility funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and jointly managed by Queen's University Belfast (QUB) and  Ulster University. The Â£2M investment from EPSRC will have significant impact for science, by expanding the use of HPC to new pools of talent and new areas of investigation for Northern Ireland. This will be done by building on the strong collaboration between Ulster University and QUB, already established through two major city deal initiatives.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
